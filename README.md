# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

## Installation

To use the the github actions in this repo, copy the .github/   folder to  use in your own  projects. This project simply gives you insight into how the gitflow works. You will need to add cypress into your package.json, and you reference the this repo for that. The yaml file does run cypress to check testing so it is necessary.

## Usage

I would suggest only using the yaml files for a personal project and edit them to to meet your needs. To use the gitflow you'll need to make sure to have a develop branch and a feature/testing branch.
